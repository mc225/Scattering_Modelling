In order to execute the CELES code, it is necessary to have the following
installed:

1. The CUDA Toolkit.

 You can check the version that you need by running the command `gpuDevice` in
 MATLAB and look for ToolkitVersion in the output.

2. A C++ compiler which is supported by MATLAB in combination with the given
CUDA Toolkit version.

Linux users: the built-in gcc compiler works fine.

Windows users: one combination that works is MATLAB 2016b, CUDA Toolkit 7.5 and
MS Visual Studio 2013 (not 2015). With MATLAB 2017a: CUDA Toolkit 8 and MS
Visual Studio 2013.


MS Visual Studio 2013 can be downloaded from:
